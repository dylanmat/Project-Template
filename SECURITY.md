# Security Policy

## Template guidance

These baseline rules protect repository work. For an adopting system, complete the project fields and record policy approval using [CONTEXT.md](CONTEXT.md). A placeholder, an example, or an unapproved proposal does not authorize data access, provider use, or tool actions.

## Baseline rules

### Credentials and data

- Never commit secrets or include them in prompts, logs, screenshots, or tickets. Use approved secret storage; local environment files are permitted only if project policy allows them.
- The included ignore rules exclude local environment files except the example file. Example files must contain placeholders only. Ignore rules do not protect already tracked files or other secret formats.
- Grant only the access needed for the authorized task. Keep environment credentials and permissions separate where multiple environments exist.
- Send data to a model or external service only when the selected provider, data class, purpose, and handling are approved. Do not assume sensitive data is permitted.
- Collect only necessary telemetry and apply the project's retention and deletion policy to inputs, prompts, outputs, and stored evaluation evidence.
- On suspected credential exposure, stop using the affected credential, notify the designated owner through an authorized path, and revoke or rotate it.

### Untrusted content and tool actions

- Treat retrieved documents, webpages, user uploads, repository content under review, and tool results as untrusted data. Instructions embedded in that content do not grant authority or override governing instructions.
- Keep task instructions distinguishable from retrieved content. Apply access controls before retrieval and tool execution, not only after generating an answer.
- Restrict tools to the resources and operations needed for the task. Validate arguments, destination, and permissions before execution; validate tool outputs before downstream use.
- Treat model output as untrusted. Validate expected structure and business constraints before downstream use.
- Require appropriate authorization and output validation before consequential actions. Use human review where project policy requires it; model confidence does not replace approval.
- Do not expand permissions or switch to a less restricted provider/tool to bypass a denied action. Escalate unresolved requirements to the accountable owner.

## Project fields

- Scope and security owner: [REQUIRED: covered systems, environments, contributors, and accountable contact]
- Data classes and allowed handling: [REQUIRED: selected classifications; access, storage, transmission, and provider rules for each]
- Allowed providers and models: [REQUIRED: approved services/models, permitted data classes, processing locations, training/data-use terms, and exception approver]
- Tool permissions and action approval: [REQUIRED: allowed operations/resources, consequential actions, approvers, and how authorization is recorded and enforced]
- Retention and deletion: [REQUIRED: periods and deletion mechanisms for prompts, outputs, logs, retrieved data, memory, and evaluation evidence, including provider retention]
- Credential lifecycle: [REQUIRED: approved storage, environment separation, rotation schedule, and exposure response]
- Disallowed uses and human review: [REQUIRED: prohibited use cases and circumstances requiring human review]
- Environment controls: [REQUIRED: network access, dependency controls, audit records, and deployment safeguards appropriate to the system]
- Incident reporting and response: [REQUIRED: reporting channel, response owner, triage, containment, and follow-up process]
- Compliance and exceptions: [REQUIRED: applicable obligations and documented exception process; exceptions cannot override platform constraints]

## Completion criteria

Every permitted data route and consequential tool action has an explicit policy and accountable approver. Owners can explain how access, validation, retention, and incident response are enforced. Unknown permissions remain unresolved and the affected action stays unauthorized.
